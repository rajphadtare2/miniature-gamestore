Mini Game Store ðŸŽ®

Mini Game Store is a microservices-powered gaming marketplace â€” my playground for experimenting with distributed systems, authentication flows, and cloud-native practices.

Current Features :

Microservices: game-service, user-service, order-service, message-service, discovery-service, and api-gateway.
Angular Frontend: Handles registration, login, and user interactions.
JWT + Keycloak: Keeps user credentials safer than loot in a final boss fight.
CORS & Security: Properly configured to avoid preflight and unauthorized nightmares.
Service Discovery: Eureka keeps track of which service is alive.

Future Features:

Reactive APIs & WebFlux
WebSocket Notifications for real-time updates
AI Game Recommendations for personalized suggestions

Why This Exists:
A sandbox to learn microservices, OAuth2/Keycloak, Docker, Kafka, and eventually reactive programming and websockets â€” all while imagining a world where games always find the right gamer.
